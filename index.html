				<h2>DnDice</h2>
				<p>I made DnDice, when running a game of Dungeons & Dragons over Christmas, everyone was playing for the first time and no one had dice. After seeing the visually busy options on the app store, I decided something much simpler would be really helpful, just to get everyone up and running.</p>
				<p>My aim was to make it as clean, simple and uncomplicated as possible. Press one of the buttons and a random dice roll will be made for the appropriate dice.</p>

			<div>
				<h2>Favourite Frames</h2>
				<p>This is a personal project I have been slowly working on, a blog in which I select a favourite still from a movie and consider what makes it great. The main focus for design was to create something light, which kept focus on the images.</p>

				<h2>'John Doe' Portfolio</h2>
				<p>A design for an imagined photography portfolio, with a focus on landscape images. I wanted to give each image itâ€™s own focus from the start, while maintaining a connection to the photographer. The bio is fixed to the side and the images are sizes to fill the rest of the screen. With more time spent on this, I would add modals, to allow the images to be viewed fullscreen.</p>

			<div>
				<h2>"Skew"</h2>
				<p>I created this to practice a more varied layout, using strong colours and angles.. A potential theme for a static page offering a service or for an event.</p>
